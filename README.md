# A Toy MIPS32 CPU Simulator Implemented in Verilog
This is a toy MIPS32 CPU simulator implemented in Verilog. It is the suggestion of CSC3050 Computer Architecture course to build such a project from scratch. Thus, that's why it's here. It is still unfinished and not formal verified, so do not use in production environments.
